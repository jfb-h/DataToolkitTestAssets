#+title: DataToolkit.jl test data files
#+author: tecosaur

Testing the set of data transformers implemented in [[https://github.com/tecosaur/DataToolkitCommon.jl][DataToolkitCommon.jl]]
requires a set of data files.

We could simply find odd links to files on the internet, but that risks them
changing or disappearing unexpectedly. Instead, we can try to find small test
files and collect them here.
